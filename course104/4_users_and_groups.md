# Create users and groups in Azure Active Directory

This lab is unique, you create a new tenant. It is like you create a new company. In the real world, you will not do this many times.

Hints:
- you have to go the way via Marketplace to create a tenant. The other ways via the short cut will not work, because the tenant is empty.
- The great thing about this lab is, you can activate Azure AD premium P2 for free and you can repeat it many times.
- Switch to your tenant... The lab does not explain how you can do this. On the top you have the Azure search bar. You see a button like a book and a funnel. Here you can switch.

The lab is straight forward. Make sure you know how to perform these tasks. Try to add more users and learn more about guest users. If you work as an admin or in a help desk role, you will create users, recover passwords, solve problems with groups and so on. This is a starting point and you must know how to do it.


Tasks:
- What is the difference between Assigned and dynamic groups?
- To use a dynamic groups, you need a field, maybe a country or city. -> If it does not work, sign out and sign in (switch back to your test tenant). You need an active Premium P2 licence to do this.

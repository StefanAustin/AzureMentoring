## Course for AZ-104

Important points to know:
- This course offers are based on Microsoft's learn platform and their free sandboxed labs.
- You cannot do things wrong, the sandboxed labs are usully restriced to the right learning content
- This course gives you additional tasks and a deeper look into Microsoft Azure. It makes you a better Azure Admin and at least somewhat job ready.
- To get the cert, you have to study the official material. Here, you only find all hands-on labs.
- If you have a subscription, I strongly recommend the matching labs on github.

Official material:
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-104 The official learning path.
- https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator Additional labs and instructions

Hint:
- You do not need to pay money for a course. Microsoft offers everything (exept the certification) for free.
- If you lost your job due Covid, you can get the AZ-104 cert (and others) for $15.

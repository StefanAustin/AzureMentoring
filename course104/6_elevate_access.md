# Get access to an Azure subscription

This lab is not a sandboxed lab. You need an own subscription. The reason is, granting the User Access Administrator role is a very powerful role.
This is a short lab, you do not need much time for it.

Tasks:
- What can you do with the role: User Access Administrator? What is the diffrence beween this role, a Contributor, a Owner, a Reader and a Global Administrator?
- Many companies grant Contributor rights to users. Is this a smart idea?
- You are new to a Company, but you want to know more about the right management in your company. Where can you find this information (it is somewhere under subscription)? Azure allows you to audit (administrative) access, this is a diffrent topic.

Hint:
The lab is very short, but for the exam, you have to know a lot about roles and the differences. Know at least the strongest five options.

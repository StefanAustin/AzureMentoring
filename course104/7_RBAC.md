Hint:
- If you start the lab, it will open a new browser window. This is the first lab like this and the first step is confusing.

- You start with two new windows. One is the lab and one is the instruction window. To get the right username, you have to go to the instruction browser window and select "Resources". There you find a user and the matching password.
- If you start the second lab, it is possible that is does not work. Sometimes you do not see an available role. Go back and start the lab again. You get new credent
ials.
- If you close the Instructions browser window or you click Done... The lab will close. Keep it open.
- If you do this lab multiple times, you see multiple users. Make sure to pick the right lab user.
- The all Services window is hidden. Click on the left top corner the icon with the three strips.

Tasks:
- What is an activity log? If you use a Windows machine, you find Event Logs. What is the difference? -> Exam relevant!

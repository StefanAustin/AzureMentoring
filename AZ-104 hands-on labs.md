1 hour standard lab, create a VM

Extra tasks:

- follow the official lab guide and finish the page / lab

- log in to Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/)with the sandbox credentials (azure learn, sandbox)

- try to find out what the commands did (search for the VM)

- draw a simple network diagram (where is the VM, can you find some interesting things)

- try to connect via the connect button. You see three options, what are they?

- what does port 22 allow (protocol)?

- what is port 3389? Can you use the protocol on Linux?

- What is a Bastion and why it such a thing useful?

- Hint: You have one hour. If you need longer, you need a new sandbox

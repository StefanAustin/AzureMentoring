## Why should you learn cloud?

- Cloud is the future
- offers a lot of free resources, gaining knowledge is cheap
- certs are not that expensive
- a lot of open job positions (do a reseach for your area) -> in Austin,TX we have 4x more cloud jobs compated to cybersec
- easy to start (free credits and a lot for the first year)
- great salary
- it is fun to learn
- if you learn cloud, you learn IT! Everything is included.
- Three "big" options (AWS, Azure, Google)
- some smaller options like linode (with free credits)

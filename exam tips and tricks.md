## How to approach an exam

You have three options:

- The cheater way with study the questions (e.g. brain dumps) -> you pass for sure in a month 

- the heavy and long way with hands-on and later you add the exam stuff to get the cert.

- the way with study the questions first, knock out the cert and learn hands-on and knowledge in depth later. 

### The first way

The first way is the easiest way and google will tell you a lot of free resources. Some of them are:

- vceguide

- vcecollection

- freedumps

- exam4training

- etc

These websites offer real exam questions and solutions. If you study these questions and read the comments, you can pass any exam quickly. There are other alternatives and you have to pay to get access:

- whizlabs

- etc

What is the difference?

The first selection offers 100% real questions, and the second uses the same questions but change some words. Contoso.com is renamed to whizlabs.com. The rest is the same. This minor change makes the difference between brain dumps (often illegal) and practice questions (legal).

My opinion:

It is really dumb to study question to pass an exam and try to get a job with that. Yes, you have the cert, but you have no chance to do your job. Remember, if you work, you are responsible for IT and security. One mistake can be very expensive.

### The second way

This is the standard way. You start with the Azure learn platform and add the gibhub labs. You take notes and build a CherryTree to expend your brain. This will take a long time (without a strong background), at least 2 or 3 monthsâ€™ full time. 

If you have the knowledge, you practice questions to knock out the cert. You can do this step in 2 weeks or less. 

### The third way

You try to knock out a cert early and then you study as much as you can until you find a job. You will fail the first interviews, but you add valuable insights. Study all interview questions in depth.

You might get a job sooner. This is the way to go if you need a job quickly. This way is tricky, because you are apply for a job and you do not have the matching knowledge to do it. If you get a job, it is a painful process.

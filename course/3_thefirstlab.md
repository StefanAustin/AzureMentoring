### How to start with the first lab

- Go to the website: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/azure-architecture-fundamentals/exercise-create-website
- Log-in with your MS account
- Start the sandbox
- sometimes you have to set permissions (review permissions -> accept), make sure to deacticate adblocker or noscript plug-ins. MS will not send you ads, but the website needs scripts.
- you have to wait ~3 minutes

The first lab runs 2 hours. This is a long time and you can do a lot. If you need longer, restart the sandbox. You can use up to 10 sandboxes a day, usually you will never reach this number. Hint: you cannot save anything.

This lab is somewhat special, you do net get a command line. Scroll down until you find: Create a WordPress website and you see: 

Sign in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com)  by using the same account you used to activate the sandbox.

### The start
Use Azure poral to log in and do the lab.

If you do this the first time, stick to the lab and learn the GUI. 

### The web page is running? (Do not check your work, it is the last thing what you do, because you might reset the lab with it)
Great job! Pick a theme in wordpress and your website is running. You build a brand new website in a very short time. This is amazing, isn't it?
You have two hours playtime and it is absolutly free.

Now it is time to discover Azure and the features.

What did you actually do? How does it work? Think critical! You skipped the boring reading part, but you need the knowledge.

Steps:
- find the learn resouce group
- what is in this group
- you see 4 things, find out what they are and document it with CherryTree, Joplin or something else. Use the official material, the Azure help links or google.
- Hint: The "type" field tells you what it is. 

You can spend hours in this lab. Everything is new, try to get the biggest idea, you learn the important things in a stuctured way later.

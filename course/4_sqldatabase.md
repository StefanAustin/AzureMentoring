The next hands-on lab is creating a SQL database. This is a 2 hour lab. Here is the link:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/azure-database-fundamentals/exercise-create-sql-database

Follow the instructions to finish the lab (do not click the las button until you finish the bonus task).

### Think about: 
- under Network connectivity, you add a Public endpoint. What does it mean? Is this a good idea?
- This lab is free, but you see a price tag. How much is a database per day? Imagine you have to buy a server, what is cheaper? 
- can you find out how powerful your clould server is?

Hint: The lab manual is outdated, the firewall setting is now part of the sqlserver (server) under Firewalls and virtal networks.

### Tasks
- what is under the resouce group?
- We have a sample database, what is in the database. Can you find some important data? How is the data constructed. 
- What is the diffrence between a rational database and a non-rational database?
- Here we use a SQL database... what type is it?

### Bonus task:
- if you have a windows and 650 MB, you can download SQL Server Management Studio (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15) and you can connect to the database via your Windows.

## The beginning of your journey

You have two options:

### First option: 
You start with the official course. 
You visit the official exam page and at the bottom are learning path. If you do all, you are ready for the test. If you start this way, you have to read a lot before you do hands-on. In my opinion, not the best approch to try things out.
AZ-900: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals 
AZ-104: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-administrator

### Second option:
You start with hands-on to see the portal and work with CLI (command line). In this course we go the second path and start with AZ-900 sandbox labs. It is important to know, that Microsoft is paying for these labs. You do not need an own account on Azure, you only need a Microsoft account.

The AZ-900 sandbox labs:
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/azure-architecture-fundamentals/exercise-create-website
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/azure-database-fundamentals/exercise-create-sql-database
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/protect-against-security-threats-azure/5-manage-password-key-vault
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-network-connectivity-azure/6-configure-access-network-security-group
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-cloud-governance-strategy-azure/9-restrict-location-azure-policy

You see: the first module is talking about a website. This is a real website and it works.

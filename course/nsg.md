### Network Security Group

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-network-connectivity-azure/6-configure-access-network-security-group

Again a small 1 hour sandbox lab. This lab teaches you what you can do with a Network Security group.

Sometimes the window is black and it does not work. You can try to reset the lab or you can log in via Azure portal and use the internal CLI. 
Next to the seach bar is a small icon -> Cloud shell

You can start a Azure CLI (it is called bash) or a Powershell shell. 

Bonus task:
Do the same lab with the portal.


### Questions:
- What is the diffrence between a Network Security Group and a Resource Group? (In this lab you use a learn resource group, but why?)
- Why can you log into the machine without a password? Explain the trick.
- What is the difference beween a public IP and a private IP?
- Describe the lab in your own words. See the big picture.

### Bonus network question:
- What is special about 10.0.0.4 or 192.168.0.2? 
- What is a CIDR notation? /24 is an example
- Delete the rule with port 80 and add again a rule with the same settings except the destination is your private IP. Can you connect? Why not?
